35503717,International League Against Epilepsy classification and definition of epilepsy syndromes with onset in childhood: Position paper by the ILAE Task Force on Nosology and Definitions.,"The 2017 International League Against Epilepsy classification has defined a three-tier system with epilepsy syndrome identification at the third level. Although a syndrome cannot be determined in all children with epilepsy, identification of a specific syndrome provides guidance on management and prognosis. In this paper, we describe the childhood onset epilepsy syndromes, most of which have both mandatory seizure type(s) and interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) features. Based on the 2017 Classification of Seizures and Epilepsies, some syndrome names have been updated using terms directly describing the seizure semiology. Epilepsy syndromes beginning in childhood have been divided into three categories: (1) self-limited focal epilepsies, comprising four syndromes: self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures, childhood occipital visual epilepsy, and photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy; (2) generalized epilepsies, comprising three syndromes: childhood absence epilepsy, epilepsy with myoclonic absence, and epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia; and (3) developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies, comprising five syndromes: epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy with spike-and-wave activation in sleep, hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome, and febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome. We define each, highlighting the mandatory seizure(s), EEG features, phenotypic variations, and findings from key investigations.",Epilepsia,eng,2022,Jun,No Data,Specchio Nicola; Wirrell Elaine C; Scheffer Ingrid E; Nabbout Rima; Riney Kate; Samia Pauline; Guerreiro Marilisa; Gwer Sam; Zuberi Sameer M; Wilmshurst Jo M; Yozawitz Elissa; Pressler Ronit; Hirsch Edouard; Wiebe Sam; Cross Helen J; Perucca Emilio; Moshé Solomon L; Tinuper Paolo; Auvin Stéphane,,"Rare and Complex Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Scientific Institute for Research and Health Care, Full Member of EpiCARE, Rome, Italy.

37804168,Scoping review and expert-based consensus recommendations for assessment and management of psychogenic non-epileptic (functional) seizures (PNES) in children: A report from the Pediatric Psychiatric Issues Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy.,"Limited guidance exists regarding the assessment and management of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) in children. Our aim was to develop consensus-based recommendations to fill this gap. The members of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Task Force on Pediatric Psychiatric Issues conducted a scoping review adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-SR) standards. This was supplemented with a Delphi process sent to pediatric PNES experts. Consensus was defined as ≥80% agreement. The systematic search identified 77 studies, the majority (55%) of which were retrospective (only one randomized clinical trial). The primary means of PNES identification was video electroencephalography (vEEG) in 84% of studies. Better outcome was associated with access to counseling/psychological intervention. Children with PNES have more frequent psychiatric disorders than controls. The Delphi resulted in 22 recommendations: Assessment-There was consensus on the importance of (1) taking a comprehensive developmental history; (2) obtaining a description of the events; (3) asking about potential stressors; (4) the need to use vEEG if available parent, self, and school reports and video recordings can contribute to a ""probable"" diagnosis; and (5) that invasive provocation techniques or deceit should not be employed. Management-There was consensus about the (1) need for a professional with expertise in epilepsy to remain involved for a period after PNES diagnosis; (2) provision of appropriate educational materials to the child and caregivers; and (3) that the decision on treatment modality for PNES in children should consider the child's age, cognitive ability, and family factors. Comorbidities-There was consensus that all children with PNES should be screened for mental health and neurodevelopmental difficulties. Recommendations to facilitate the assessment and management of PNES in children were developed. Future directions to fill knowledge gaps were proposed.",Epilepsia,eng,2023,Dec,No Data,Reilly Colin; Jette Nathalie; Johnson Emma C; Kariuki Symon M; Meredith Francesca; Wirrell Elaine; Mula Marco; Smith Mary Lou; Walsh Samantha; Fong Choong Yi; Wilmshurst Jo M; Kerr Mike; Valente Kette; Auvin Stephane,,"Research Department, Young Epilepsy, Lingfield, UK.

32611798,Seizures in Children.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders seen in children, with the highest incidence in the first year of life. Diagnostic accuracy can be challenging because many seizure mimics must be considered. Electroencephalography and neuroimaging can be critical in determining etiology and syndrome. Genetic testing is a high-yield endeavor, particularly in early-life epilepsies. Up to one-fourth of children with epilepsy will develop drug-resistant seizures. Comorbidities are very common in children with epilepsy, including intellectual disability in 25% and learning disability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a significant minority. These comorbidities must be recognized and addressed as part of the child's overall care.",Pediatrics in review,eng,2020,Jul,No Data,Fine Anthony; Wirrell Elaine C,,"Division of Epilepsy and Division of Child and Adolescent Neurology, Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

In approximately 15% of these patients, the seizures are not adequately controlled with anticonvulsive drugs, and such patients are potential candidates for surgical treatment and majority are children. Epilepsy surgery in children, who have been carefully chosen, can result in either seizure freedom or a marked (>90%) reduction in seizures in approximately two-third of children with intractable seizures. In the multimodality presurgical evaluation approach, sufficient concordance should be established among various independent investigations, thus identifying the location and extent of the epileptogenic zone with a high degree of confidence. Early surgery improves the quality of life and cognitive and developmental outcome of the child. Surgically remediable epilepsies in children should be identified early and include temporal lobe epilepsy with focal lesions, lesional extratemporal epilepsies, hemispherical epilepsies, and gelastic epilepsy with hypothalamic hamartoma, and can be treated by resective or disconnection surgery. Palliative procedures include corpus callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation for children with diffuse and multifocal epilepsies, who are not candidates for resective surgery. Deep brain stimulation in patients with epilepsy is still under evaluation.

31903630,Sleep in mothers of children with epilepsy and its relation to their children's sleep.,"We conducted a cross-sectional study to examine sleep in mothers of children with epilepsy and its relation to their children's sleep. A total of 133 dyads of mothers and children with epilepsy aged 1.5-6 years were recruited between 2015 and 2018 from a children's hospital in northern Taiwan. Participating families provided demographic and health information, with children wearing an actigraphy monitor for 7 days and mothers completing sleep and depressive mood questionnaires. We found that 76 (57.1%) of the mothers had poor sleep quality, with 65 (48.9%) mothers having a clinically significant depressive symptom score. Mean actigraphic wake after sleep onset in children was 1.42 (standard deviation = 0.51) hours, with 126 (94.7%) of the children having a clinically significant sleep disturbance score. Multivariate regression analyses showed that higher depressive symptom scores in mothers (β = 0.14; p < .01) and higher sleep disturbance scores in children (β = 0.07; p = .04) were associated with poorer maternal sleep quality, even when maternal demographic characteristics and the child's clinical and epilepsy variables were considered. Findings from our study suggest that sleep disturbances are a shared problem for mothers and their children with epilepsy. Sleep in both mothers and their children with epilepsy should be evaluated in pediatric neurologic practices, with maternal depressive symptoms screened concurrently. Future pediatric epilepsy studies are warranted to examine whether a family-based intervention program would be effective to improve sleep in mother-child dyads and to promote better health and functioning of the entire family.",Research in nursing & health,eng,2020,Apr,No Data,Tsai Shao-Yu; Lee Wang-Tso; Lee Chien-Chang; Jeng Suh-Fang; Weng Wen-Chin,,"School of Nursing, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

9068881,Epilepsy in children.,"Childhood epilepsies comprise a broad range of disorders which vary from benign to progressive and disabling. Accurate diagnosis of epilepsy type and determination of aetiology, when possible, are essential for appropriate treatment. The most common seizure type encountered in children is febrile seizures. These represent a benign condition which is not, in fact, epilepsy and usually does not require antiepileptic medication. When partial seizures occur in childhood, benign syndromes with spontaneous remission, such as rolandic epilepsy, must be distinguished from symptomatic epilepsies which may be refractory to medical management. Complex partial seizures in young children may appear different than in adults. The adverse effect profiles and dosing regimens of antiepileptic drugs in children are also different than in adults, and influence the choice of treatment. Epilepsy surgery should be considered for some children with intractible partial seizures. Generalized epilepsies also have a broader spectrum in children. The idiopathic generalized absence epilepsies are usually easy to control with medication. They range from childhood absence epilepsy which tends to remit in adolescence to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which is a lifelong condition. In contrast, the seizures of West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are difficult to control, and treatment involves therapeutic modalities rarely used in adults such as ACTH and the ketogenic diet. Many childhood epilepsy syndromes have a familial predisposition, and the genetic bases for several disorders have been described.",Bailliere's clinical neurology,eng,1996,Dec,No Data,Arnold S T; Dodson W E,,"Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis Children's Hospital, MO 63110, USA.","Arnold S T (Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis Children's Hospital, MO 63110, USA.)",

Identifying the more common single-gene epilepsies will aid in targeting resources, the prioritization of diagnostic testing and development of precision therapy. Previous studies of genetic testing in epilepsy have not been prospective and population-based. Therefore, the population-incidence of common genetic epilepsies remains unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and phenotypic spectrum of the most common single-gene epilepsies in young children, and to calculate what proportion are amenable to precision therapy. This was a prospective national epidemiological cohort study. All children presenting with epilepsy before 36 months of age were eligible. Children presenting with recurrent prolonged (>10 min) febrile seizures; febrile or afebrile status epilepticus (>30 min); or with clusters of two or more febrile or afebrile seizures within a 24-h period were also eligible. Participants were recruited from all 20 regional paediatric departments and four tertiary children's hospitals in Scotland over a 3-year period. DNA samples were tested on a custom-designed 104-gene epilepsy panel. Detailed clinical information was systematically gathered at initial presentation and during follow-up. Clinical and genetic data were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and genetic scientists. The pathogenic significance of the genetic variants was assessed in accordance with the guidelines of UK Association of Clinical Genetic Science (ACGS). Of the 343 patients who met inclusion criteria, 333 completed genetic testing, and 80/333 (24%) had a diagnostic genetic finding. The overall estimated annual incidence of single-gene epilepsies in this well-defined population was 1 per 2120 live births (47.2/100 000; 95% confidence interval 36.9-57.5). PRRT2 was the most common single-gene epilepsy with an incidence of 1 per 9970 live births (10.0/100 000; 95% confidence interval 5.26-14.8) followed by SCN1A: 1 per 12 200 (8.26/100 000; 95% confidence interval 3.93-12.6); KCNQ2: 1 per 17 000 (5.89/100 000; 95% confidence interval 2.24-9.56) and SLC2A1: 1 per 24 300 (4.13/100 000; 95% confidence interval 1.07-7.19). Presentation before the age of 6 months, and presentation with afebrile focal seizures were significantly associated with genetic diagnosis. Single-gene disorders accounted for a quarter of the seizure disorders in this cohort. Genetic testing is recommended to identify children who may benefit from precision treatment and should be mainstream practice in early childhood onset epilepsy.",Brain : a journal of neurology,eng,2019,Aug,01,Symonds Joseph D; Zuberi Sameer M; Stewart Kirsty; McLellan Ailsa; O'Regan Mary; MacLeod Stewart; Jollands Alice; Joss Shelagh; Kirkpatrick Martin; Brunklaus Andreas; Pilz Daniela T; Shetty Jay; Dorris Liam; Abu-Arafeh Ishaq; Andrew Jamie; Brink Philip; Callaghan Mary; Cruden Jamie; Diver Louise A; Findlay Christine; Gardiner Sarah; Grattan Rosemary; Lang Bethan; MacDonnell Jane; McKnight Jean; Morrison Calum A; Nairn Lesley; Slean Meghan M; Stephen Elma; Webb Alan; Vincent Angela; Wilson Margaret,,"Paediatric Neurosciences Research Group, Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, UK.

28379373,Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity suggest therapeutic implications in SCN2A-related disorders.,"Mutations in SCN2A, a gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, have been associated with a spectrum of epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we report the phenotypes of 71 patients and review 130 previously reported patients. We found that (i) encephalopathies with infantile/childhood onset epilepsies (≥3 months of age) occur almost as often as those with an early infantile onset (<3 months), and are thus more frequent than previously reported; (ii) distinct phenotypes can be seen within the late onset group, including myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (two patients), Lennox-Gastaut not emerging from West syndrome (two patients), and focal epilepsies with an electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep-like EEG pattern (six patients); and (iii) West syndrome constitutes a common phenotype with a major recurring mutation (p.Arg853Gln: two new and four previously reported children). Other known phenotypes include Ohtahara syndrome, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, and intellectual disability or autism without epilepsy. To assess the response to antiepileptic therapy, we retrospectively reviewed the treatment regimen and the course of the epilepsy in 66 patients for which well-documented medical information was available. We find that the use of sodium channel blockers was often associated with clinically relevant seizure reduction or seizure freedom in children with early infantile epilepsies (<3 months), whereas other antiepileptic drugs were less effective. In contrast, sodium channel blockers were rarely effective in epilepsies with later onset (≥3 months) and sometimes induced seizure worsening. Regarding the genetic findings, truncating mutations were exclusively seen in patients with late onset epilepsies and lack of response to sodium channel blockers. Functional characterization of four selected missense mutations using whole cell patch-clamping in tsA201 cells-together with data from the literature-suggest that mutations associated with early infantile epilepsy result in increased sodium channel activity with gain-of-function, characterized by slowing of fast inactivation, acceleration of its recovery or increased persistent sodium current. Further, a good response to sodium channel blockers clinically was found to be associated with a relatively small gain-of-function. In contrast, mutations in patients with late-onset forms and an insufficient response to sodium channel blockers were associated with loss-of-function effects, including a depolarizing shift of voltage-dependent activation or a hyperpolarizing shift of channel availability (steady-state inactivation). Our clinical and experimental data suggest a correlation between age at disease onset, response to sodium channel blockers and the functional properties of mutations in children with SCN2A-related epilepsy.",Brain : a journal of neurology,eng,2017,May,01,Wolff Markus; Johannesen Katrine M; Hedrich Ulrike B S; Masnada Silvia; Rubboli Guido; Gardella Elena; Lesca Gaetan; Ville Dorothée; Milh Mathieu; Villard Laurent; Afenjar Alexandra; Chantot-Bastaraud Sandra; Mignot Cyril; Lardennois Caroline; Nava Caroline; Schwarz Niklas; Gérard Marion; Perrin Laurence; Doummar Diane; Auvin Stéphane; Miranda Maria J; Hempel Maja; Brilstra Eva; Knoers Nine; Verbeek Nienke; van Kempen Marjan; Braun Kees P; Mancini Grazia; Biskup Saskia; Hörtnagel Konstanze; Döcker Miriam; Bast Thomas; Loddenkemper Tobias; Wong-Kisiel Lily; Baumeister Friedrich M; Fazeli Walid; Striano Pasquale; Dilena Robertino; Fontana Elena; Zara Federico; Kurlemann Gerhard; Klepper Joerg; Thoene Jess G; Arndt Daniel H; Deconinck Nicolas; Schmitt-Mechelke Thomas; Maier Oliver; Muhle Hiltrud; Wical Beverly; Finetti Claudio; Brückner Reinhard; Pietz Joachim; Golla Günther; Jillella Dinesh; Linnet Karen M; Charles Perrine; Moog Ute; Õiglane-Shlik Eve; Mantovani John F; Park Kristen; Deprez Marie; Lederer Damien; Mary Sandrine; Scalais Emmanuel; Selim Laila; Van Coster Rudy; Lagae Lieven; Nikanorova Marina; Hjalgrim Helle; Korenke G Christoph; Trivisano Marina; Specchio Nicola; Ceulemans Berten; Dorn Thomas; Helbig Katherine L; Hardies Katia; Stamberger Hannah; de Jonghe Peter; Weckhuysen Sarah; Lemke Johannes R; Krägeloh-Mann Ingeborg; Helbig Ingo; Kluger Gerhard; Lerche Holger; Møller Rikke S,,"Department of Pediatric Neurology and Developmental Medicine, University Children's Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.

35074891,Development and Validation of a Prediction Model for Early Diagnosis of <i>SCN1A</i>-Related Epilepsies.,"Pathogenic variants in the neuronal sodium channel α1 subunit gene (<i>SCN1A</i>) are the most frequent monogenic cause of epilepsy. Phenotypes comprise a wide clinical spectrum, including severe childhood epilepsy; Dravet syndrome, characterized by drug-resistant seizures, intellectual disability, and high mortality; and the milder genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), characterized by normal cognition. Early recognition of a child's risk for developing Dravet syndrome vs GEFS+ is key for implementing disease-modifying therapies when available before cognitive impairment emerges. Our objective was to develop and validate a prediction model using clinical and genetic biomarkers for early diagnosis of <i>SCN1A</i>-related epilepsies.",Neurology,eng,2022,Mar,15,Brunklaus Andreas; Pérez-Palma Eduardo; Ghanty Ismael; Xinge Ji; Brilstra Eva; Ceulemans Berten; Chemaly Nicole; de Lange Iris; Depienne Christel; Guerrini Renzo; Mei Davide; Møller Rikke S; Nabbout Rima; Regan Brigid M; Schneider Amy L; Scheffer Ingrid E; Schoonjans An-Sofie; Symonds Joseph D; Weckhuysen Sarah; Kattan Michael W; Zuberi Sameer M; Lal Dennis,andreas.brunklaus@glasgow.ac.uk.,"From the Pediatric Neurosciences Research Group (A.B., I.G., J.D.S., S.M.Z.), Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow; Institute of Health and Wellbeing (A.B., I.G., J.D.S., S.M.Z.), University of Glasgow, UK; Centro de Genética y Genómica, Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana (E.P.-P.), Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute (E.P.-P., D.L.), Department of Quantitative Health Sciences (J.X., M.W.K.), and Epilepsy Center, Neurological Institute (D.L.), Cleveland Clinic, OH; Department of Genetics (E.B., I.d.L.), University Medical Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Department of Child Neurology (B.C., A.-S.S.), University Hospital Antwerp, Belgium; Reference Centre for Rare Epilepsies, Department of Pediatric Neurology (N.C., R.N.), Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Université de Paris, France; Institute of Human Genetics (C.D.), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany; Neuroscience Department (R.G., D.M.), Children's Hospital A.

26597089,The genetic landscape of the epileptic encephalopathies of infancy and childhood.,"Epileptic encephalopathies of infancy and childhood comprise a large, heterogeneous group of severe epilepsies characterised by several seizure types, frequent epileptiform activity on EEG, and developmental slowing or regression. The encephalopathies include many age-related electroclinical syndromes with specific seizure types and EEG features. With the molecular revolution, the number of known monogenic determinants underlying the epileptic encephalopathies has grown rapidly. De-novo dominant mutations are frequently identified; somatic mosaicism and recessive disorders are also seen. Several genes can cause one electroclinical syndrome, and, conversely, one gene might be associated with phenotypic pleiotropy. Diverse genetic causes and molecular pathways have been implicated, involving ion channels, and proteins needed for synaptic, regulatory, and developmental functions. Gene discovery provides the basis for neurobiological insights, often showing convergence of mechanistic pathways. These findings underpin the development of targeted therapies, which are essential to improve the outcome of these devastating disorders.",The Lancet.

The clinical features, electroencephalogram(EEG), brain imaging, gene results and treatment were summarized. <b>Results:</b> Twelve patients were followed up successfully among the 13 patients with SYNGAP1 variants. The last follow-up age was 5 years and 7 months (3 years and 1 month to 9 years).The onset age of seizures was 2 years (4 months to 3 years). Seizure types included eyelid myoclonia with or without absence (9 cases), myoclonic seizure (5 cases), atypical absence (4 cases), suspicious atonic seizures(4 cases),unclassified fall attack (6 cases), and the frequency of seizures varied from several times to more than 100 times per day. Four cases had the mimic phenotype of myoclonic astatic epilepsy. The seizures of 10 cases could be triggered by eating (5 cases), emotion (5 cases), fever (3 cases), voice (2 cases), fatigue (2 cases), etc. Electroencephalography (10 cases) showed interictal generalized or focal epileptiform discharges (9 cases), and atypical aphasia (4 cases), myoclonic seizure (2 cases) and eyelid myoclonic seizure (1 case) were monitored. Of the 12 cases, 9 were added with valproate, all of which were effective (the frequency of seizures reduced>50%). Five cases received combined levetiracetam, in 3 the treatments were effective. To last follow-up, 3 cases were seizure free from 6 months to 1 year and 1 month, but the remaining 7 cases still had seizures, one or several times per day. All 13 cases had developmental retardation (speech ability impaired mostly), 2 cases were severe, 10 cases were moderate, 1 case was mild. The SYNGAP1 gene variants of 13 patients were all de novo, including 12 variants. Among them, 4 were frameshift variants, 4 were nonsense variants, 2 were missense variants and 2 were splice site variants. <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients with SYNGAP1-related epilepsy have an early onset age and many seizure types. The main seizure type is eyelid myoclonia with or without absence, and other seizure types include myoclonic seizure, atypical absence, unclassified fall attack, etc. Valproate is effective in most patients, but seizures in some patients might be intractable.

34550020,Spectral changes following resective epilepsy surgery and neurocognitive function in children with epilepsy.,"Decelerated resting cortical oscillations, high-frequency activity, and enhanced cross-frequency interactions are features of focal epilepsy. The association between electrophysiological signal properties and neurocognitive function, particularly following resective surgery, is, however, unclear. In the current report, we studied intraoperative recordings from intracranial electrodes implanted in seven children with focal epilepsy and analyzed the spectral dynamics both before and after surgical resection of the hypothesized seizure focus. The associations between electrophysiological spectral signatures and each child's neurocognitive profiles were characterized using a partial least squares analysis. We find that extent of spectral alteration at the periphery of surgical resection, as indexed by slowed resting frequency and its acceleration following surgery, is associated with baseline cognitive deficits in children. The current report provides evidence supporting the relationship between altered spectral properties in focal epilepsy and neuropsychological deficits in children. In particular, these findings suggest a critical role of disrupted thalamocortical rhythms, which are believed to underlie the spectral alterations we describe, in both epileptogenicity and neurocognitive function.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Spectral alterations marked by decelerated resting oscillations and ectopic high-frequency activity have been noted in focal epilepsy. We leveraged intraoperative recordings from chronically implanted electrodes pre- and postresection to understand the association between these electrophysiological phenomena and neuropsychological function. We find that the extent of spectral alteration, indexed by slowed resting frequency and its acceleration following resection, is associated with baseline cognitive deficits. These findings provide novel insights into neurocognitive impairments in focal epilepsy.",Journal of neurophysiology,eng,2021,Nov,01,Arski Olivia N; Wong Simeon M; Warsi Nebras M; Martire Daniel J; Ochi Ayako; Otsubo Hiroshi; Donner Elizabeth; Jain Puneet; Kerr Elizabeth N; Smith Mary Lou; Ibrahim George M,,"Program in Neuroscience and Mental Health, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In many patients, the seizures appear to contribute to the mental retardation. Thus, if the lives of these children are to improve, seizure control is essential. However, medical treatment can interfere with cognition and cause behavioral disturbances, making life very difficult for the child and the child's family. With the introduction of 10 new antiepileptic drugs in the last decade, the treatment of epilepsy in multiply handicapped children has significantly advanced. These new antiepileptic drugs may improve seizure control, medication tolerance, or both. Although the ultimate therapeutic goal is to keep children seizure free and alert, compromises regarding medication choice and dosage are still necessary in many cases. Novel treatment options, such as the vagus nerve stimulator, may decrease seizure frequency without behavioral or cognitive side effects.
