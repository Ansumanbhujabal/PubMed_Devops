35132910,"Emerging COVID-19 variants and their impact on SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, therapeutics and vaccines.","The emergence of novel and evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 has fostered the need for change in the form of newer and more adaptive diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. On the other hand, developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic technologies is now more challenging due to emerging variants and varying symptoms exhibited among the infected individuals. In addition to this, vaccines remain the major mainstay of prevention and protection against infection. Novel vaccines and drugs are constantly being developed to unleash an immune response for the robust targeting of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated variants. In this review, we provide an updated perspective on the current challenges posed by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants/variants and the evolution of diagnostic techniques to enable their detection. In addition, we also discuss the development, formulation, working mechanisms, advantages, and drawbacks of some of the most used vaccines/therapeutic drugs and their subsequent immunological impact.Key messageThe emergence of novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2 in the past couple of months, highlights one of the primary challenges in the diagnostics, treatment, as well as vaccine development against the virus.Advancements in SARS-CoV-2 detection include nucleic acid based, antigen and immuno- assay-based and antibody-based detection methodologies for efficient, robust, and quick testing; while advancements in COVID-19 preventive and therapeutic strategies include novel antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs and SARS-CoV-2 targeted vaccines.The varied COVID-19 vaccine platforms and the immune responses induced by each one of them as well as their ability to battle post-vaccination infections have all been discussed in this review.",Annals of medicine,eng,2022,Dec,No Data,Fernandes Queenie; Inchakalody Varghese Philipose; Merhi Maysaloun; Mestiri Sarra; Taib Nassiba; Moustafa Abo El-Ella Dina; Bedhiafi Takwa; Raza Afsheen; Al-Zaidan Lobna; Mohsen Mona O; Yousuf Al-Nesf Mariam Ali; Hssain Ali Ait; Yassine Hadi Mohamad; Bachmann Martin F; Uddin Shahab; Dermime Said,,"Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.

33322035,Comparison of Rapid Antigen Tests for COVID-19.,"Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based tests are widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a result that these tests cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2.",Viruses,eng,2020,Dec,10,Yamayoshi Seiya; Sakai-Tagawa Yuko; Koga Michiko; Akasaka Osamu; Nakachi Ichiro; Koh Hidefumi; Maeda Kenji; Adachi Eisuke; Saito Makoto; Nagai Hiroyuki; Ikeuchi Kazuhiko; Ogura Takayuki; Baba Rie; Fujita Kensuke; Fukui Takahiro; Ito Fumimaro; Hattori Shin-Ichiro; Yamamoto Kei; Nakamoto Takato; Furusawa Yuri; Yasuhara Atsuhiro; Ujie Michiko; Yamada Shinya; Ito Mutsumi; Mitsuya Hiroaki; Omagari Norio; Yotsuyanagi Hiroshi; Iwatsuki-Horimoto Kiyoko; Imai Masaki; Kawaoka Yoshihiro,,"Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.

To date, countries have relied on the prevention of the disease through isolation, quarantine, and clinical care of affected individuals. However, studies on the roles of asymptomatic and mildly infected subjects in disease transmission, use of antiviral drugs, and vaccination of the general population will be very important for mitigating the effects of the eventual return of this pandemic. Initial investigations are ongoing to evaluate antigenic structures of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. There also is a need to comprehensively compile the details of previous studies on SARS-related vaccines that can be extrapolated to identify potent vaccine targets for developing COVID-19 vaccines.

33308664,Benefits and limitations of serological assays in COVID-19 infection.,"Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical for achieving control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.",The Indian journal of tuberculosis,eng,2020,Dec,No Data,Sidiq Zeeshan; Hanif M; Dwivedi Kaushal Kumar; Chopra K K,irldlndc@rntcp.org.,"New Delhi Tuberculosis Centre, JLN Marg, New Delhi, India.

39097440,Should SARS-CoV-2 serological testing be used in the decision to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine booster? A pro-con assessment.,"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has saved millions of lives in the past few years. To maintain a high level of protection, particularly in at-risk populations, booster doses are recommended to counter the waning of circulating antibody levels over time and the continuous emergence of immune escape variants of concern (VOCs). As anti-spike serology is now widely available, it may be considered a useful tool to identify individuals needing an additional vaccine dose, i.e., to screen certain populations to identify those whose plasma antibody levels are too low to provide protection. However, no recommendations are currently available on this topic. We reviewed the relevant supporting and opposing arguments, including areas of uncertainty, and concluded that in most populations, spike serology should not be used to decide about the administration of a booster dose. The main counterarguments are as follows: correlates of protection are imperfectly characterised, essentially owing to the emergence of VOCs; spike serology has an intrinsic inability to comprehensively reflect the whole immune memory; and booster vaccines are now VOC-adapted, while the commonly available commercial serological assays explore antibodies against the original virus.",Vaccine,eng,2024,Nov,14,Augello Matteo; Wagenhäuser Isabell; Krone Manuel; Dauby Nicolas; Ferrara Pietro; Sabbatucci Michela; Ruta Simona; Rezahosseini Omid; Velikov Petar; Gkrania-Klotsas Effrossyni; Montes Jose; Franco-Paredes Carlos; Goodman Anna L; Küçükkaya Sertaç; Tuells Jose; Harboe Zitta Barrella; Epaulard Olivier,oepaulard@chu-grenoble.fr.,"Clinic of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, San Paolo Hospital, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.

34032973,Congregational COVID-19 Conversations: Utilization of Medical-Religious Partnerships During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.,"Over the last 12-months during the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued public health instructions with the hope of mitigating the spread of the virus. Through existing relationships established by an academic hospital, we established weekly community conference calls to disseminate such critical information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. From these calls, we were able to collaborate in a more intimate manner with faith-based organizations, whereby we emphasized and planned the role they could undertake during the pandemic. Such emphasis was made between our medical institution and various faith-based organizations through meetings titled ""Congregational COVID-19 Conversations."" Over the past 12-months, we held virtual meetings with 38 faith-based organizations: 15 Christian congregations, 21 Jewish synagogues, and 2 Islamic masjids. We describe in detail in this report a narrative summary of the meetings. From these meetings, we discussed several COVID-19-related themes that included how to have their place of worship disseminate public health messaging, aid in preparing buildings for public worship, and insight into preparing their regions for aid in both COVID-19 testing and for potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sites. This medical-religious partnership has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants emphasis in that it has the potential to serve a vital role in mitigating COVID-19-related disparities in certain communities, as well as potentially ending the COVID-19 pandemic completely.",Journal of religion and health,eng,2021,Aug,No Data,Monson Kimberly; Oluyinka MopeninuJesu; Negro DanaRose; Hughes Natasha; Maydan Daniella; Iqbal Sahir; Golden Sherita H; Teague Paula; Hale W Daniel; Galiatsatos Panagis,panagis@jhmi.edu.,"Healthy Community Partnership, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.
