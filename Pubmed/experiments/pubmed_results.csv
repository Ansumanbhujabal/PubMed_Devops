35132910,"Emerging COVID-19 variants and their impact on SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, therapeutics and vaccines.","The emergence of novel and evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 has fostered the need for change in the form of newer and more adaptive diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. On the other hand, developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic technologies is now more challenging due to emerging variants and varying symptoms exhibited among the infected individuals. In addition to this, vaccines remain the major mainstay of prevention and protection against infection. Novel vaccines and drugs are constantly being developed to unleash an immune response for the robust targeting of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated variants. In this review, we provide an updated perspective on the current challenges posed by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants/variants and the evolution of diagnostic techniques to enable their detection. In addition, we also discuss the development, formulation, working mechanisms, advantages, and drawbacks of some of the most used vaccines/therapeutic drugs and their subsequent immunological impact.Key messageThe emergence of novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2 in the past couple of months, highlights one of the primary challenges in the diagnostics, treatment, as well as vaccine development against the virus.Advancements in SARS-CoV-2 detection include nucleic acid based, antigen and immuno- assay-based and antibody-based detection methodologies for efficient, robust, and quick testing; while advancements in COVID-19 preventive and therapeutic strategies include novel antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs and SARS-CoV-2 targeted vaccines.The varied COVID-19 vaccine platforms and the immune responses induced by each one of them as well as their ability to battle post-vaccination infections have all been discussed in this review.",Annals of medicine,eng,2022,Dec,No Data,Fernandes Queenie; Inchakalody Varghese Philipose; Merhi Maysaloun; Mestiri Sarra; Taib Nassiba; Moustafa Abo El-Ella Dina; Bedhiafi Takwa; Raza Afsheen; Al-Zaidan Lobna; Mohsen Mona O; Yousuf Al-Nesf Mariam Ali; Hssain Ali Ait; Yassine Hadi Mohamad; Bachmann Martin F; Uddin Shahab; Dermime Said,,"Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.","Fernandes Queenie (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Inchakalody Varghese Philipose (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.); Merhi Maysaloun (Department of Internal Medicine, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas, Dallas, USA.); Mestiri Sarra (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford , West Yorkshire, UK.); Taib Nassiba (Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.)",

35619009,COVID-19 diagnostic methods in developing countries.,"COVID-19 has become one of the few leading causes of death and has evolved into a pandemic that disrupts everyone's routine, and balanced way of life worldwide, and will continue to do so. To bring an end to this pandemic, scientists had put their all effort into discovering the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For their dedication, now, we have a handful of COVID-19 vaccines. Worldwide, millions of people are at risk due to the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Despite the lack of clinically authorized antiviral medications and vaccines for COVID-19, clinical trials of many recognized antiviral agents, their combination, and vaccine development in patients with confirmed COVID-19 are still ongoing. This discovery gave us a chance to get immune to this disease worldwide and end the pandemic. However, the unexpected capacity of mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus makes it difficult, like the recent SAS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Therefore, there is a great necessity to spread the vaccination programs and prevent the spread of this dreadful epidemic by identifying and isolating afflicted patients. Furthermore, several COVID-19 tests are thought to be expensive, time-consuming, and require the use of adequately qualified persons to be carried out efficiently. In addition, we also conversed about how the various COVID-19 testing methods can be implemented for the first time in a developing country and their cost-effectiveness, accuracy, human resources requirements, and laboratory facilities.",Environmental science and pollution research international,eng,2022,Jul,No Data,Maniruzzaman Md; Islam Md Missile; Ali Md Hazrat; Mukerjee Nobendu; Maitra Swastika; Kamal Mohammad Amjad; Ghosh Arabinda; Castrosanto Melvin A; Alexiou Athanasios; Ashraf Ghulam Md; Tagde Priti; Rahman Md Habibur,pharmacisthabib@gmail.com.,"Department of Global Medical Science, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Gangwon-do, Wonju, 26426, Korea. pharmacisthabib@gmail.com.","Maniruzzaman Md (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Islam Md Missile (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.); Ali Md Hazrat (Department of Internal Medicine, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas, Dallas, USA.); Mukerjee Nobendu (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford , West Yorkshire, UK.); Maitra Swastika (Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.); Kamal Mohammad Amjad (Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Gina Cody School of Engineering, Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada jason.leblanc@nshealth.ca sana.anbuhi@concordia.ca.); Ghosh Arabinda (Department of Global Medical Science, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Gangwon-do, Wonju, 26426, Korea. pharmacisthabib@gmail.com.)",

33394144,Detection technologies and recent developments in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19. KEY POINTS : • Provides comprehensive information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19 • Nucleic acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose • Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2021,Jan,No Data,Rai Praveen; Kumar Ballamoole Krishna; Deekshit Vijaya Kumar; Karunasagar Indrani; Karunasagar Iddya,iddya.karunasagar@nitte.edu.in.,"Nitte (Deemed to be University), University Enclave, Medical Sciences Complex, Deralakatte, Mangaluru, 575018, India. iddya.karunasagar@nitte.edu.in.","Rai Praveen (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Kumar Ballamoole Krishna (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.); Deekshit Vijaya Kumar (Department of Internal Medicine, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas, Dallas, USA.); Karunasagar Indrani (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford , West Yorkshire, UK.); Karunasagar Iddya (Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.)",
33322035,Comparison of Rapid Antigen Tests for COVID-19.,"Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based tests are widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a result that these tests cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2.",Viruses,eng,2020,Dec,10,Yamayoshi Seiya; Sakai-Tagawa Yuko; Koga Michiko; Akasaka Osamu; Nakachi Ichiro; Koh Hidefumi; Maeda Kenji; Adachi Eisuke; Saito Makoto; Nagai Hiroyuki; Ikeuchi Kazuhiko; Ogura Takayuki; Baba Rie; Fujita Kensuke; Fukui Takahiro; Ito Fumimaro; Hattori Shin-Ichiro; Yamamoto Kei; Nakamoto Takato; Furusawa Yuri; Yasuhara Atsuhiro; Ujie Michiko; Yamada Shinya; Ito Mutsumi; Mitsuya Hiroaki; Omagari Norio; Yotsuyanagi Hiroshi; Iwatsuki-Horimoto Kiyoko; Imai Masaki; Kawaoka Yoshihiro,,"Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.","Yamayoshi Seiya (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Sakai-Tagawa Yuko (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.); Koga Michiko (Department of Internal Medicine, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas, Dallas, USA.); Akasaka Osamu (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford , West Yorkshire, UK.); Nakachi Ichiro (Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.); Koh Hidefumi (Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Gina Cody School of Engineering, Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada jason.leblanc@nshealth.ca sana.anbuhi@concordia.ca.); Maeda Kenji (Department of Global Medical Science, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Gangwon-do, Wonju, 26426, Korea. pharmacisthabib@gmail.com.); Saito Makoto (Nitte (Deemed to be University), University Enclave, Medical Sciences Complex, Deralakatte, Mangaluru, 575018, India. iddya.karunasagar@nitte.edu.in.); Nagai Hiroyuki (Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.)",Adachi Eisuke ()
34062874,Point-of-Care PCR Assays for COVID-19 Detection.,"Molecular diagnostics has been the front runner in the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time. Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the impact of POC tests cannot be ignored. As a consequence, there has been an increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection.

33666147,Lessons learned 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 emergence leading to COVID-19 pandemic.,"Without modern medical management and vaccines, the severity of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might approach the magnitude of 1894-plague (12 million deaths) and 1918-A(H1N1) influenza (50 million deaths) pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced.

34355645,COVID-19: clinical presentation and detection methods.,"The unending outburst of COVID-19 has reinforced the necessity of SARS-CoV-2 identification approaches for the prevention of infection transmission and the proper care of severe and critical patients. As there is no cure, a prompt and reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 is vital to counter the spread and to provide adequate care and treatment for the infection. Currently, RT-PCR is a gold standard detection method for the qualitative and quantitative detection of viral nucleic acids. Besides, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is also a primarily used method for qualitative estimation of viral load. However, almost all the detection methods have their pros and cons in terms of specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, cost, time consumption, the need for sophisticated laboratories, and the requirement of skilled technical experts to carry out the detection tests. Thus, it is suggested to integrate different techniques to enhance the detection efficiency and accurateness for SARS-CoV2.

Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests.

34497366,Advancements in detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection for confronting COVID-19 pandemics.,"As one of the major approaches in combating the COVID-19 pandemics, the availability of specific and reliable assays for the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and its proteins is essential to identify the infection in suspected populations, make diagnoses in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, and determine clearance of the virus after the infection. For these purposes, use of the quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for detection of the viral nucleic acid remains the most valuable in terms of its specificity, fast turn-around, high-throughput capacity, and reliability. It is critical to update the sequences of primers and probes to ensure the detection of newly emerged variants. Various assays for increased levels of IgG or IgM antibodies are available for detecting ongoing or past infection, vaccination responses, and persistence and for identifying high titers of neutralizing antibodies in recovered individuals. Viral genome sequencing is increasingly used for tracing infectious sources, monitoring mutations, and subtype classification and is less valuable in diagnosis because of its capacity and high cost. Nanopore target sequencing with portable options is available for a quick process for sequencing data. Emerging CRISPR-Cas-based assays, such as SHERLOCK and AIOD-CRISPR, for viral genome detection may offer options for prompt and point-of-care detection. Moreover, aptamer-based probes may be multifaceted for developing portable and high-throughput assays with fluorescent or chemiluminescent probes for viral proteins. In conclusion, assays are available for viral genome and protein detection, and the selection of specific assays depends on the purposes of prevention, diagnosis and pandemic control, or monitoring of vaccination efficacy.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,eng,2022,Jan,No Data,Zhou Yuan; Zhang Li; Xie You-Hua; Wu Jian,jian.wu@fudan.edu.cn.,"Department of Microbiology & Parasitology, MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, China. jian.wu@fudan.edu.cn.","Zhou Yuan (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Zhang Li (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.); Xie You-Hua (Department of Internal Medicine, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas, Dallas, USA.); Wu Jian (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford , West Yorkshire, UK.)",
38996774,"Recapitulating COVID-19 detection methods: RT-PCR, sniffer dogs and electronic nose.","In December 2019, a number of subjects presenting with an unexplained pneumonia-like illness were suspected to have a link to a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, this illness was identified as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Committee on Virus Classification. Since its initial identification, the virus has rapidly sperad across the globe, posing an extraordinary challenge for the medical community. Currently, the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the most reliable method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2. This procedure involves collecting oro-pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals. Nevertheless, for the early detection of low viral loads, a more sensitive technique, such as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), has been suggested. Despite the high effectiveness of RT-PCR, there is increasing interest in utilizing highly trained dogs and electronic noses (eNoses) as alternative methods for screening asymptomatic individuals for SARS-CoV-2. These dogs and eNoses have demonstrated high sensitivity and can detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs), enabling them to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative individuals.

36656511,The Potential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics.,"The infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Globally, there have been millions of infections and fatalities. Unfortunately, the virus has been persistent and a contributing factor is the emergence of several variants. The urgency to combat COVID-19 led to the identification/development of various diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction and antigen tests) and treatment (repurposed drugs, convalescent plasma, antibodies and vaccines) options. These treatments may treat mild symptoms and decrease the risk of life-threatening disease. Although these options have been fairly beneficial, there are some challenges and limitations, such as cost of tests/drugs, specificity, large treatment dosages, intravenous administration, need for trained personal, lengthy production time, high manufacturing costs, and limited availability. Therefore, the development of more efficient COVID-19 diagnostic and therapeutic options are vital. Nanobodies (Nbs) are novel monomeric antigen-binding fragments derived from camelid antibodies. Advantages of Nbs include low immunogenicity, high specificity, stability and affinity. These characteristics allow for rapid Nb generation, inexpensive large-scale production, effective storage, and transportation, which is essential during pandemics. Additionally, the potential aerosolization and inhalation delivery of Nbs allows for targeted treatment delivery as well as patient self-administration. Therefore, Nbs are a viable option to target SARS-CoV-2 and overcome COVID-19. In this review we discuss (1) COVID-19; (2) SARS-CoV-2; (3) the present conventional COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics, including their challenges and limitations; (4) advantages of Nbs; and (5) the numerous Nbs generated against SARS-CoV-2 as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.",Molecular diagnosis & therapy,eng,2023,Mar,No Data,Naidoo Dhaneshree Bestinee; Chuturgoon Anil Amichund,chutur@ukzn.ac.za.,"Discipline of Medical Biochemistry and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Howard College, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, 4013, South Africa. chutur@ukzn.ac.za.","Naidoo Dhaneshree Bestinee (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Chuturgoon Anil Amichund (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.)",

Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles released from almost all cells and are crucially involved in cell-cell communication. Interestingly, COVID-19 viral particles produce exosomes that moderate communication between infected and uninfected cells. Hence, there is growing evidence highlighting the crucial implications of exosomes in COVID-19 infection, transmission, intercellular spread, and reinfection. On the other hand, clinical trials have demonstrated mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as a promising therapeutic strategy for severely affected COVID-19 patients. Also, convalescent plasma-derived exosomes have been proposed for multiple efficacies in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, messenger RNAs (mRNA)-loaded exosomes were superior to mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles as a delivery system. Hence, exosomes can be used to safely induce SARS-CoV-2 immunity via their loading with mRNAs encoding immunogenic forms of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Moreover, exosomes can be used as a nano-delivery system for microRNA to alleviate cytokine storm and prevent the progression of organ failure in COVID-19 patients. The present review summarizes state of the art concerning the role of exosomes in COVID-19 infection and accompanying organ complications as well as the potential use of exosomes in COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, drug delivery, and vaccination.

The availability of vaccines for COVID-19 have been largely successful, but many questions still remain unanswered. In spite of the original enthusiasm, clinical studies using convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies have shown limited benefit. Moreover, the emergence of Long-COVID syndrome in most infected patients necessitates the development of treatment approaches that may prevent viral entry by blocking both serine proteases involved, as with a liposomal blend of the natural flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,eng,2021,No Data,No Data,Theoharides T C; Lauritano D; Ronconi G; Calvisi V; Conti P,,"Postgraduate Medical School, University of Chieti, Chieti, Italy.","Theoharides T C (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Lauritano D (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.); Ronconi G (Department of Internal Medicine, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas, Dallas, USA.); Calvisi V (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford , West Yorkshire, UK.); Conti P (Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.)",
33172592,Update in COVID-19 in the intensive care unit from the 2020 HELLENIC Athens International symposium.,"The 2020 International Web Scientific Event in COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients aimed at updating the information and knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic in the intensive care unit. Experts reviewed the latest literature relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients, such as epidemiology, pathophysiology, phenotypes of infection, COVID-19 as a systematic infection, molecular diagnosis, mechanical ventilation, thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 associated co-infections, immunotherapy, plasma treatment, catheter-related bloodstream infections, artificial intelligence for COVID-19, and vaccination. Antiviral therapy and co-infections are out of the scope of this review. In this review, each of these issues is discussed with key messages regarding management and further research being presented after a brief review of available evidence.","Anaesthesia, critical care & pain medicine",eng,2020,Dec,No Data,Rello Jordi; Belliato Mirko; Dimopoulos Meletios-Athanasios; Giamarellos-Bourboulis Evangelos J; Jaksic Vladimir; Martin-Loeches Ignacio; Mporas Iosif; Pelosi Paolo; Poulakou Garyphallia; Pournaras Spyridon; Tamae-Kakazu Maximiliano; Timsit Jean-François; Waterer Grant; Tejada Sofia; Dimopoulos George,,"Department of Critical Care Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.","Rello Jordi (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Belliato Mirko (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.); Dimopoulos Meletios-Athanasios (Department of Internal Medicine, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Texas, Dallas, USA.); Giamarellos-Bourboulis Evangelos J (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford , West Yorkshire, UK.); Jaksic Vladimir (Translational Cancer Research Facility, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.); Martin-Loeches Ignacio (Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Gina Cody School of Engineering, Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada jason.leblanc@nshealth.ca sana.anbuhi@concordia.ca.); Mporas Iosif (Department of Global Medical Science, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Gangwon-do, Wonju, 26426, Korea. pharmacisthabib@gmail.com.); Poulakou Garyphallia (Nitte (Deemed to be University), University Enclave, Medical Sciences Complex, Deralakatte, Mangaluru, 575018, India. iddya.karunasagar@nitte.edu.in.); Pournaras Spyridon (Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.); Tamae-Kakazu Maximiliano (Department of Biotechnology, Delhi Technological University, Shahbad Daulatpur, Delhi 110042, India.); Timsit Jean-François (State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China.)","Pelosi Paolo (); Waterer Grant (Drugs Testing Laboratory Avam Anusandhan Kendra, Raipur, India.); Tejada Sofia (New Delhi Tuberculosis Centre, JLN Marg, New Delhi, India.); Dimopoulos George ()"
33689569,Road toward universal COVID-19 testing method - A review.,"Patients infected with novel coronavirus exhibit a wide range of symptoms from common cold to pneumonia. Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease.",Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,eng,2021,Jul,04,Abdul Bari Ahamed Basha; Samuel Prince Johnson,,"Physiology, Vels Medical College, Thiruvallur, India.","Abdul Bari Ahamed Basha (Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA. minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.); Samuel Prince Johnson (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.)",
35576549,Petroleum jelly and COVID-19 prevention.,"Since the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a significant impact on public health and, also the clinical benefits of the medications are so limited, preventive measures may be able to help control its spread. Because the petroleum jelly compound could alter the physicochemical properties that affect adhesion, we investigated the preventive role of Petroleum jelly on covid-19 infection. Forty people with no sign and no history of covid-19 infection, were included in this study. They use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) nasally twice a day for about two months. After that time, participants tested by RT-qPCR to determine any infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. There was a significant difference in terms of RT-qPCR results between the intervention and control groups. Petroleum jelly may be effective in preventing covid-19 infection (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 13).
