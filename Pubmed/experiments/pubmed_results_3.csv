33400058,Recent Developments on Therapeutic and Diagnostic Approaches for COVID-19.,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on this topic and made a summary of current development and future perspectives.",The AAPS journal,eng,2021,Jan,05,Majumder Joydeb; Minko Tamara,minko@pharmacy.rutgers.edu.,"Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA.

33126180,COVID-19 diagnosis -A review of current methods.,"A fast and accurate self-testing tool for COVID-19 diagnosis has become a prerequisite to comprehend the exact number of cases worldwide and to take medical and governmental actions accordingly. SARS-CoV-2 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) infection was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and then it has rapidly spread around the world, causing <sub>~</sub>14 million active cases with <sub>~</sub>582,000 deaths as of July 2020. The diagnosis tools available so far have been based on a) viral gene detection, b) human antibody detection, and c) viral antigen detection, among which the viral gene detection by RT-PCR has been found as the most reliable technique. In this report, the current SARS-CoV-2 detection kits, exclusively the ones that were issued an ""Emergency Use Authorization"" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, were discussed. The key structural components of the virus were presented to provide the audience with an understanding of the scientific principles behind the testing tools. The methods that are still in the early research state were also reviewed in a subsection based on the reports available so far.",Biosensors & bioelectronics,eng,2021,Jan,15,Yüce Meral; Filiztekin Elif; Özkaya Korin Gasia,meralyuce@sabanciuniv.edu.,"SUNUM Nanotechnology Research and Application Centre, Sabanci University, 34956, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.

33664170,"COVID-19 pandemic: from origins to outcomes. A comprehensive review of viral pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and management.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have a mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic.",Le infezioni in medicina,eng,2021,Mar,01,Ochani RohanKumar; Asad Ameema; Yasmin Farah; Shaikh Shehryar; Khalid Hiba; Batra Simran; Sohail Muhammad Rizwan; Mahmood Syed Faisal; Ochani Rajkumar; Hussham Arshad Mohammad; Kumar Arjan; Surani Salim,,"Department of Internal Medicine, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.
